            I grew up with my grandparents in Qianbai since I was 2 years old. Living in QIanbai was a great experience—people were well-connected
            with each other. There was a middle-sized public area in front of each house, and when it came to dinner time,
            after all day’s work, each family would move their tables to that public area and have dinner there. For our
            residents in Qianbai, we enjoyed a connection with the community, with the nature, and we were very good at finding
            the balance between privacy and intimacy. After dinner and moving away tables, we sat in several circles, sharing
            different feelings with others and helping with each other. For me, I loved to listen to imaginary and remote
            stories from elderly people. These stories raised my curiosity toward the outside world and taught me many ancient
            and wise principles. Another great experience in Dianbai was the culture of courtesy. I was encouraged to greet
            elder people when I saw them. Walking in Qianbai, you could easily hear the greet voice from local residents.
            We respected each other, and this in returns made each other.
