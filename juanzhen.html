          <h2>About her tough life</h2>
          <p class="description">
            At the beginning of the 20th century, China was a Semi-colonial and semi-feudal society. Farmers lived in China were destined
            to be poor under the turbulent situation, and it was during this period, in 1918, Zhou Juanzhen came to this
            world as a poor farmer’s daughter. Like many other children in the small village, Juanzhen started to help farm
            when she was only 5 years old, doing some easy and basic work. When she was older, she went to a primary school.
            Helping farm and doing homework became all her after school activity, and in some important point of farming
            like harvest, she was forced by her family to excuse from study for few days. As a result, she would miss the
            lesson in those days. When she entered her Junior high, the family started to expect her to spend more time in
            farming, and she missed more lessons than ever. In one exam, her teacher gave the class 5 questions. Because
            Juanzhen missed many lessons before, she only got 2 correct. As a good student, it was a big strike. Even though
            she was very clever, she felt it became very difficult for her to follow the curriculum. Moreover, because she
            missed so many classes, she stayed in the same grade for two years, and she had to study with those who were
            younger than her which made her feel embarrassed. Therefore, she ended her study in her Junior high. After that,
            she worked in the filed for the rest of her life, get married, and raised a boy like most other village girls.

          <h2>A memory during 1950s</h2>
          <p class="description">
            In the 1950s, competing warlords and foreign powers scrambled for political spoils. One man in Qianbai joined the army of
            one of the warlords and encouraged many other young men in the village to join the army too. Juanzhen’s friend
            Baolai was one of those men. In their eyes, joining the army meant they could have something to eat without farming,
            see many other places in China, and get many opportunities to escape farming. However, when Baolai joined the
            army, he realized what he imagined before was impossible. In fact, they could hardly have enough food. Long marchbroke
            his shoes, and the changing climate made him always sick. Baolai could no longer bear that kind of life.Therefore,
            during one fight, he escaped and returned to Qianbai. Before he returned home, he stole some new clothes in order
            to let his parents not worry. When the villagers saw Baolai came back, wearing new clothes, they believed he
            must get a lot of wealth in the army. Some villagers sent Baolai rice and cotton, which was very precious at
            that time, to please him, dreaming for his return, but when other men escaped from the army and returned to Qianbai,
            villagers realized those men and Baolai didn’t get any wealth. Villagers felt they were lied, and started to
            laugh at them by calling them “counterrevolution”.

          <h2>Her favorite festival</h2>
          <p class="description">
            When I asked Juanzhen which festival was her favorite, she told me National Day without any hesitation. In the past, many
            people in Qinabai went to work in Shanghai or did business in Zhejiang province. When it was National Day, all
            the workers would have a long holiday lasting for three days,(In the past, most workers did not have to work
            only in Saturday) so a lot of workers in Shanghai or Zhejiang province would go back to Wuxi, visiting family
            or some famous places such as Tortoise Head Garden. As a result, during the National Day, many quiet places would
            be filled with people. Juanzhen loved this the liveliness in National Day. In this day, she would also visit
            those famous places with her friends. Besides escaping from farming for one day, she could also see a lot of
            people outside Wuxi. In that pale period, these people greatly meet her curiosity toward the world.
