            <h2>My grandpa: a retired solider</h2>
            <p class="description">
              My grandpa was born in a village in Qianbai. His family used to be wealthy in that village at once, leaving a big house in
              the best location of the village: a place next to river and at the entrance of the village. However, my grand-grandpa
              had some lovers in Shanghai and left home for 30 years, leaving two children in school and his wife. Without
              a man in the house, the whole family had a extreme hard life. As an elder brother in the family, my grandpa
              attended the army and sent moneyback to support the family and his little brother’s study. After 4 years’ military
              life, my grandfather came back and met my grandmother. They got married and built a house in Qianbai, in front
              of my grandmother’s old house. Because my grandfather was a solider, he was assigned a job in a local bank,
              and my grandmother later found a job in the hospital.

            <h2>Liangtang Bridge</h2>
            <div class="mdui-col-xs-9 nopadding">
              <p class="description">
                Liangtang Bridge locates in the junction of three towns: Dongjiang, Yangming, and Huazhuang. According to the folklore, the
                bridge was built during the late 1900s, as a hub center in east Wuxi. During the middle 20th century, a lot
                of local capital emerged in Wuxi and rolled up an industrial wave in Wuxi. During this wave, a lot of factories
                were built on one side of the bridge, while the other side of the bridge was filled with villages. Qianbai
                is one of those villages very next to the Liangtang Bridge. When my grandpa was young, he enjoyed a small
                trip to Liangtang Bridge with his friends. In summer, when the temperature was high they would cool themselves
                and swim in the river freely. Sometimes they would walk across the bridge and exploited a world different
                from theirs, but most time, they would sit at their side of the bridge and watched the prosperous scenes
                on the other side of the bridge. Dianbai and the small city on the other side of the bridge showed two different
                worlds to my grandpa and other people, expanding their earliest eyesight and raising earliest curiosity toward
                the world outside Qianbai, and , perhaps, because of this, my grandfather chose to become a soldier when
                he grew up without any hesitation, many people chose to learn skills in Shanghai, and many other people chose
                to do business in other provinces.
