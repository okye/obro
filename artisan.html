            <h2>An artisan in Qianbai</h2>
            <p class="description">
              There’re some people you only know their nickname. I always call the man in the picture Uncle Sanmao, and he is the son of
              Zhou Juanzhen. Sanmao is the name of a cartoon character who is a tramp. Because Uncle Sanmao often went to
              different places to do his door and window business, he was given this friendly nickname by other villagers.
              In the past, villagers in Qianbai believed when boys had grown up, there were no dinner any more for them in
              the family, which means boys had to make living for themselves. Some of them would farm in the filed, and some
              of them, such as Sammao, learn certain skills and become an artisan.

            <h2>A coin collector</h2>
            <p class="description">
              Uncle Sanmao’s family was very poor in the past. The demand for money invisibly made him interested in collecting coins.
              Many villagers would preserve money passed by the last generation, some of the coins could be dated back to
              middle Qing dynasty. Uncle Sammao also had some coins passed by his grandfather, and he’ve bought all the coins
              that he didn’t have from the villagers, including those in Qing dynasty, the Republic of China era, and early
              people’s Republic of China. Now he will buy the commemorative coins issued by the bank each year. When he has
              time, he likes to go to the coin market in Temple Nanchan, a famous temple in the downtown of Wuxi, and if
              he has good luck that day, he can increase the type of his coin collections.

            <h2>Qiangmen</h2>
            <div class="mdui-col-xs-9 nopadding">
              <p class="description">
                QIanmen is the residence of a local landlord whose family name is “Tian”, and it is like a courtyard, so it is also called
                “Tianheyuan”, meaning the courtyard of Tian family. Qianmen was built at about 1930s. The descendants refreshed
                it several times so that Qianmen was still existed. When Uncle Sanmao was young, one of his classmates lived
                in Qianmen. Therefore, he was often invited to visit Qianmen. The center of the QIanmen is a small typical
                east China courtyard. There are many unknown flowers and plants in the courtyard, dotted in delicate rockeries,
                enlightening their understand of the nature. Sometimes they would catch butterflies among the flowers, sometimes
                they would climb the rockeries to see the view from the top, and sometimes they would hide and seek between
                the courtyard and the pavilion.
