            <h2>An old man used to work as a blacksmith in Shanghai</h2>
            <p class="description">
              A man who doesn’t farm or have a job after primary school or junior high has to “look for food“ himself in Qianbai, otherwise,
              they will be looked down by other villagers. Mr.Yi was introduced to be an apprentice in Shanghai after his
              primary school, and he was only 15 years old at that time. Blacksmith, rower and weaver were popular jobs at
              that time for low class in Shanghai, and Mr.Yi was very lucky to be an apprentice of a blacksmith. However,
              having a good job didn’t mean it’s also an easy job. Before anyone finished their apprenticeship, he had to
              do three years’ tough job. As an apprentice, Mr.Yi got up at 4 a.m. everyday, and he had to work about 16 hours
              until 10 p.m. Doing one of the toughest jobs, however, his wage was extremely low, only 3 yuan each month.
              After three years’ practice and experience, Mr.Yi finished his apprenticeship and was prepared and allowed
              to work as a formal employee. His wage grew to about 50 yuan a month, which was even higher than a teacher
              at that time. When he was 25 years old, he returned to QIanbai and married his childhood sweetheart. After
              that he worked in Shanghai and went back home when it’s holiday. Now Mr.Yi’s granddaughter has married and
              gives birth to his grand-granddaughter. They together lived in the same big house happily.

              other.
            </h2>
            <p class="description">
              When Mr.Yi worked as an apprentice in Shanghai, he had a very busy lifestyle that he barely chatted with other apprentices,
              and others apprentices did the same too. As a result, although he and other apprentices lived under the same
              roof for three years, he couldn’t even call the name of some roommates. It was not only the tough job that
              gave Mr. Yi pressure, but also the coldness between people and people. In Wuxi, people would visit each other
              frequently in the city no matter how distant they are. He still cherished the first time my grandmother and
              grandfather visited him when he came back from Shanghai. They brought him strong sense of belonging to the
              community.

            <h2>Favorite thing is cattle</h2>
            <div class="mdui-col-xs-9 nopadding">
              <p class="description">
                Some people like car, some people like clothes. For Mr.Yi, cattle is his favorite thing. He is very proud for three of his
                collection of cattle: a bull made of serials, a bull made of redwood and a bull made of glaze. The reason
                Mr.Yi loves cattle is because his zodiac is a cow, and his personality is very much the same of the cattle.
                Throughout his life, Mr.Yi is always very hardworking like a farm cattle who take a lot of tough jobs for
                farming. Moreover, cattle also represents honest in China, just like Mr.Yi. Because of these similarities,
                he has a natural fondness for the cattle. “Mao once said’ I would rather like to be an old cow and help do
                tough jobs.” Mr.Yi told me. In fact, Cattle are not only the proudness of Mr.Yi, but also represent a common
                value of the whole society at that time, representing a spirit that can lead to a better life

            <h2>Old house for five generations</h2>
            <div class="mdui-col-xs-9 nopadding">
              <p class="description">
                The house Mr.Yi lives in now is actually built when he married. When Mr.Yi was young, he lived with his family in a house
                that was build around 1880s by the first group of people who settled down in QIanbai. At first, the house
                was very small, only having a sitting room and a bedroom. As the number of people in the family increased,
                the house was expanded by the generation lived in. In fact, the house was first built with earth mixture
                and thatch. It was Mr.Yi’s grandparents who replaced the soil wall with bricks and thatch roof with tiles.
                In the last year, a corner of the old house was hit by the thunder. Although the house had been abandoned
                and about to be demolished by the government, Mr.Yi still repaired it because he thought the heritage of
                the ancestor was a part of his life, a symbol of an era
