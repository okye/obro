            I grew up from a small village in Wuxi called Qianbai, a self-constructed community in east Wuxi. Nowadays,like most other
            villages in China, residents here are mostly elderly people. There are people who devoted their whole life to
            farming, people who left home far away to Shanghai and became an artisan, also people who worked in the local
            weaver factory. In the past century, many people have walked out from this small village and participated in
            different events: civil wars, working in different cities, or starting their own business. Some of them returned
            to Qianbai to start a family, while some of them left and seldom or never came back. Qianbai is now threatened
            by the urbanization movement. To preserve the unique type of culture, I interviewed with four residents in the
            village before it disappeared like most of other villages.
